# Videosync
Watch a video together

This is a quick little node application, which allows you to watch a video together. Playing, pausing and skipping in time will be synchronized over multiple clients using [socket.io](socket.io). The video file currently has to be accessible via HTTP, maybe in future there will be a P2P streaming feature. 

You can either install this on your own server, or try it out at [videosync.nils-hellerhoff.de](videosync.nils-hellerhoff.de). Keep in mind though, that there are no "rooms" or anything similar, so it's only single user right now.
